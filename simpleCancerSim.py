#Simulation explanation:
#  Based on the incidence rate parameter, cancer starts in a population according to a poisson process
#  The cancer is only diagnosed/noticed by the sufferer at some stage after it has developed. It is 
#     assumed that once it is noticed it is immediately diagnosed by a doctor. A more complex
#     simulation later can nodel the scenario where the sufferer has to make an appointment to be seen
#     by their doctor after noticing the cancer in order to have it diagnosed.
#  This is a discrete simulation, progressing on a day-to-day basis.
#  The term "stage" refers to the number of days since a cancer started in a sufferer.
#  There are a fixed number of treatment appointment slots per day and a sufferer is always booked
#     into the next available slot when cancer is diagnosed and sufferers never miss or
#     postpone their appointments.
#  A sufferer always survives until their appointment but, of course, the prob of successful treatment
#     decreases even to zero.
#  When a suffer is treated, the treatment is immediately successful or they die immediately, i.e.
#     this simulation does not model time to recover or time during which the cancer progresses to its
#     terminal stage.
#  The incidence rate of cancer is relatively low so the simulation does not model the decrease in
#     the population size due to cancer deaths.
