#Simulation explanation:
#  Based on the incidence rate parameter, cancer starts in a population according to a poisson process.
#  The cancer progresses according to a Gompertz model (i.e. the probability of the sufferer dying from it 
#     at any particular stage is modeled as a Gompertz distribution.) The distribution is specified
#     by providing the Median stage (i.e. number of days) and also the probability of death before half this
#     median. (See misc.py) i.e. MEDmort is such that CDF(MEDmort)=0.5 and PHALFmort = CDFmort(MEDmort/2)
#     In this model the two parameters are picked as follows:
#        - MEDmort will be picked from a uniform distribution from 60 to 700 (approx 2 months to 2 years)
#        - PHALFmort will be fixed at 0.02 (experiments suggest this as generating a reasonable shape)
#  The cancer is only diagnosed/noticed by the sufferer at some stage after it has developed. It is 
#     assumed that once it is noticed it is immediately diagnosed by a doctor. A more complex
#     simulation later can nodel the scenario where the sufferer has to make an appointment to be seen
#     by their doctor after noticing the cancer in order to have it diagnosed.
#  The probability of noticing the cancer follows a Gompertz model which is related to the progress model
#     as follows: 
#     The Median number of days is picked from a uniform distribution from CDFINVmort(0.01) to MEDmort
#     The ProbHalfMedian is picked from a uniform distribution from 0.02 to 0.2
#  This is a discrete simulation, progressing on a day-to-day basis.
#  The term "stage" refers to the number of days since a cancer started in a sufferer.
#  There are a fixed number of treatment appointment slots per day and a sufferer is always booked
#     into the next available slot when cancer is diagnosed and sufferers never miss or
#     postpone their appointments.
#  A sufferer always survives until their appointment but, of course, the prob of successful treatment
#     decreases even to zero.
#  When a suffer is treated, the treatment is immediately successful or they die immediately, i.e.
#     this simulation does not model time to recover or time during which the cancer progresses to its
#     terminal stage.
#  The probability of the treatment being successful is based simply on a probability derived from the 
#     stage in the mortality model as follows: at stage(day) x, CDFmort(x) = p, then the prob of
#     successful treatment is 1-p.
#  The incidence rate of cancer is relatively low so the simulation does not model the decrease in
#     the population size due to cancer deaths.
